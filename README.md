# Task 1: CODE GENERATION

## LLM: ChatGPT

### First request:
* For the first step i ask to ChatGPT this request:
>Using the following file .java : [TimetableImpl.java, TimetableFactory.java, Pair.java], complete the following code for to obtain all correct test: [Test.java]


* The answer is:
>To implement the TimetableFactory interface, you need to create a class that provides implementations for each of its methods.
>Below is the implementation for the TimetableFactory interface: [TimetableFactoryImpl.java]


>And here is the implementation for the Timetable interface: [TimetableImpl.java]

>These implementations should provide the required functionality for the tests in your Test class. You can uncomment the initFactory method in the Test class and use these implementations to run your tests.


* For the second step i ask to ChatGPT this request:
>how to fix the following error:
```
error: cannot find symbol
        Map<Pair<String, String>, Integer> newData = new HashMap<>(table1.getData());
                                                                         ^
  symbol:   method getData()
  location: variable table1 of type Timetable
```

* The answer is:
>To resolve the error cannot find symbol in your code, you need to ensure that the Timetable interface provides a method called getData() which returns the data stored in the timetable. Let's add this method to the Timetable interface:

```
package org.example;

import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;

public interface Timetable {
    
    Timetable addHour(String activity, String day);
    
    Set<String> activities();

    Set<String> days();

    int getSingleData(String activity, String day);

    int sums(Set<String> activities, Set<String> days);
    
    // Add this method to the interface
    Map<Pair<String, String>, Integer> getData();
}
```

>Now, implement this method in your TimetableImpl class:
```
@Override
public Map<Pair<String, String>, Integer> getData() {
    return data;
}
```

>With these changes, the getData() method will be available in your Timetable interface, and you can use it to retrieve the data stored in the timetable objects. This should resolve the compilation error you encountered.
